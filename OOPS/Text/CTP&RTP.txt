CTP/ CT Binding/ Static Binding (Compile Time Polymorphism)
Binding happens during compile time

Note:
Which method/variable to be called is decided by compiler during Compile time based on reference variable type no based on object creation.
 
Examples of CTP
-> Variable Shadowing
-> Method Shadowing
-> Method Overloading
-> Constructor Overloading


RTP/ RT Binding/ Dynamic Binding
Binding happens during run time

Note:
Which method to be called is decided during Runtime based on object creation not based on reference variable type.

Example of RTP
-> Method Overriding
