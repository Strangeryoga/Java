String is a group, collection or sequence of characters but in java string is a final class which is present inside java.lang package.
String class extends object class and implements CharSequence, Comparable and Serializable interfaces.

1. CharSequence
This interface is used to maintain the sequence of characters

2. Comparable
This interface is used to compare the object of same class with an instance of the class.
instance -----> object
It provides a method which is used to compare the object known as compareTo().
O1 > O2 ===> +ve
O1 < O2 ===> -ve
O1 == O2 ==> 0

3. Serializable
It is marker interface.
This interface is used to maintain steps of the data.
Marker interface means the interface which has no data members.


String Literals:
Syntax: String var.name="Literals";
When we create a string object using string literals the object will be created inside SCP(String Constant Pool).
The JVM first checks SCP whether object with the same content is already created or not.
If created it returns the reference of the existing object.
                                           ---------------
If not created then the object with the content is created in the SCP.





length()
return type of length() is int
This method is used to return the number of characters present in the string.
